        <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Mr. Bill Stiles is the Executive Director of Old Savannah City Mission (OSCM) in Savannah, Georgia. Bill has been at OSCM for three years and lives with his wife Connell in a beautiful old Savannah Victorian home. Born in 1947 to Thelma Williamson Stiles and John R. Stiles Jr. at the Old Charity Hospital in Savannah, GA, Bill and his family first resided at 311 East Duffy Street. The next year they moved to Skidaway Road across the marsh from Wormsloe Plantation when Skidaway Road was not even complete and the only way to access the area was on the trolley car by way of Central Avenue.

Bill’s first job experience was at the age of 8, when he began cutting grass on Isle of Hope. He is a 1965 graduate of Sol C. Johnson high school and a 1969 graduate of Hampton University, Hampton Virginia with a degree in Bio-Chemistry. Upon graduation, Bill served in the U S Army receiving an honorable discharge in 1972.

In 1976, Bill and his wife Connell opened Stiles for Living, Inc., an upscale home furnishings and gift shop at 1310 Abercorn Street in the Victorian District. And in 1979, Bill started Stiles For Living Realty. In 1982, Stiles For Living opened its second location in Oglethorpe Mall, becoming the first African-American business to operate in a regional mall in southeast Georgia. It was through his construction business that he started doing volunteer work at Old Savannah City Mission at the request of his wife who is the Director of Development. Because of his multi-faceted abilities, Bill was later hired as the Director of Operations in 2008.

Bill has chaired and served on numerous boards and committees throughout his career. Bill married his college sweetheart, Connell, in the spring of 1972 and through that union they are the proud parents of three (3) sons, William Elliott (31), Byron Adams (27), and Jordan Winston (18). He came to know Christ at an early age and currently attends The Sanctuary of Savannah. Bill credits his marriage to Connell as being the pivotal point that chartered his Christian journey. Together they have established a profound everlasting relationship that is truly grounded in their Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

The Mission was founded through the inspiration of Larry McDaniel, Pastor of The Sanctuary in Savannah, Georgia, after he was invited to preach at the Los Angeles Mission by Reverend Jim Lewis. When Larry would return to preach at The Sanctuary in Savannah, he would tell the congregation about the Los Angeles Mission. The Mission’s ministry was contagious. And soon, members of The Sanctuary were on board to start a Mission in Savannah. Pastor Larry brought members of his church with him to Los Angeles. They caught the vision of Rescue Ministry too. Under Larry’s leadership, the Old Savannah City Mission was established in 1997. In a real sense, this was a daughter mission. Jim encouraged Larry to grow and develop a residential, recovery program patterned after the one at the Los Angeles Mission.

Several years after the establishment of the Old Savannah City Mission Pastor McDaniel and the Board of Directors invited Jim Lewis to become the Executive Director of the Mission. Through his leadership the Mission grew and became perhaps the best known and only Five Star Gospel Mission in the Savannah area.

While serving as Executive Director of the Los Angeles Mission Reverend Lewis developed UTI, Urban Training Institute. He continued to develop UTI in Savannah. It champions “high standards, strong boundaries and clear direction.” It is a vehicle that advances transformation. It gives formerly homeless drug addicts, alcoholics, ex-offenders and others who feel themselves outcast to become STUDENTS. For those who have little or no self esteem, labels are removed and they are given a new name. This is fundamental to the ministry of the Old Savannah City Mission. No one is called “homeless, guests or clients.” UTI students, staff and volunteers refer to those they serve as “friends and neighbors.”

UTI is the “crown jewel” of the Old Savannah City Mission. It transforms students from being a receiver to being a giver. The students are the engine of the entire operation of the Mission. Students are empowered, trusted and held accountable. Jim’s definition of success is when the student excels the teacher— in line with John 14:12, “Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father.”

Greatest Accomplishment
The Georgia Department of Corrections nominated the Old Savannah City Mission’s Urban Training Institute’s Fresh Start Division to receive the Association of Paroling Authorities International’s Community Award. The presentation on May 18, 2010 put some wind under the wings of Savannah’s Five Star Gospel Rescue Mission.

Greatest Challenge
What is our greatest challenge? “It is the down to earth, nuts and bolts. It is our cash flow problem. It’s funding! The Old Savannah City Mission is privately funded. It receives no public or United Way funds. Because we are a Gospel Rescue Mission we are intentionally politically incorrect. Here at OSCM we walk by faith and not by sight; however our fountain of faith runs low sometimes. We know God never fails, but He does make us nervous. God always comes through.

Greatest Joy
We delight to see people learn because when they learn God’s Word, they change. I love to teach God’s Word. To see it germinate in someone’s heart and grow ... to see the work of God in someone’s life. My greatest joy is when I see a student “get it.”
